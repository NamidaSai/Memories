LDJAM 48 COMPO: The theme was "Deeper and Deeper."

After looking at my options during brainstorming, I got stuck on "Ageing" as a manifestation of going deeper. Why? Going deeper into old age, yes, but also gaining a deeper understanding of things. You have all the skills and experiences you've gathered during your life at your disposal. That's when I thought about Memories: an abstract game representing life as a collection of memories.

The main inspiration for this game comes from Rod Humble's [The Marriage](http://rodvik.com/rodgames/marriage.html) and Wassily Kandinsky's [Composition 8](https://www.google.com/search?q=wassily+kandinsky%27s+composition+8&safe=strict&sxsrf=ALeKk02oVeYk8lPF4QfLlfucMtgWJu0e3w:1619393314535&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwimrY6axprwAhXMPsAKHRaSA38Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1536&bih=792#imgrc=Qc4NoX6PxjX11M)

I've been learning gamedeving and Unity since April 2020. For me, Game Jams are a great opportunity to just let go and try something new, different. And there's nothing quite like Ludum Dare <3

Enjoy!
